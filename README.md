# Glitch-Merge-To-Main

Merge your work as you export from the glitch editor to your main branch on GitHub automatically.

## How to use

1. Import the code in action.yml into your repository's Actions->Workflows.
2. Connect your repo to Glitch and import it to its workspace.
3. Perform your edits as usual.
4. **Export!** your code will be merged and comments will be transferred to your main branch.

## How to Customize

If you want to use this with any other branch(es), just edit the head and base variables.

## Future steps

I'll try to make a bidirectional version that also updates the Glitch copy, but for now just importing the latest code from Github seems to be enough

## Questions?

I have thoroughly tested this action, but if you have any suggestions, please [open an issue!](https://github.com/leozusa/Glitch-Merge-To-Main/issues/new)
